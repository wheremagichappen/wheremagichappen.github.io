description: Our initial plan was to use Qualysis motion capture along with the HTC Vive to create a more immersive and accurate experience. Unfortunately, motion capture tracking system uses infrared system like HTC Vive which interfered with each other. We had to scrap off our works and found a different way to deal with the fighting system, scaling system.
